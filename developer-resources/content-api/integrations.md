# Integrations

Strapi generates an API for you to access your content. But how can you connect a React, Ruby, Gatsby application to it?
It is important to know what is an API.

## Get started

Today, any programming language has an HTTP client allowing you to execute requests to an API and therefore interact with it. Javascript has [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), Ruby has [Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday), [HTTParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty), Python has [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) etc...

Integrate Strapi with a multitude of frameworks, frontend or backend programming languages just below.

::: note
The REST API by default does not populate any relations, media fields, components, or dynamic zones. Use the [`populate` parameter](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/database-apis-reference/rest/populating-fields.md) to populate specific fields.
